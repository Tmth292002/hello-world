# hello-world
This is my first programme
Hi my name is Tran Mai Trung Hieu, and I'm working at HO CHI MINH CITY UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY (HCMUT), i'm freshman, hmmm, turning sophomore soon. My department and majors
aren't concern about coding, but i like whole things about computer and internet. So, i learn code by myself, and i hope i gradually develop and improve my skills best as soon as possible. Hope you guys pay attention to me when you read my profile and help me to study code. I'm a newbieeeee ~
